<p>This mod allows you to tap the interaction key to interact when …</p>

<ul>
  <li>… answering pagers</li>
  <li>… picking locks</li>
  <li>… setting up ECM jammers at doors</li>
</ul>

<p>I think that most interactions are so short, that toggling the interaction is pretty unnecessary. But if you have ever picked a lock for a whole minute, you really want at least at some interactions a toggle function. So I copied the code from the WolfHUD mod, which does this job, and modified it a little.
Now you can add toggle interaction to every HUD you want.</p>
