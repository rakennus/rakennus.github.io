## Toggle interaction / Press2Hold / tap to interact :: for just some interactions 

This mod allows you to tap the interaction key to interact when …

- … answering pagers
- … picking locks
- … setting up ECM jammers at doors

I think that most interactions are so short, that toggling the interaction is pretty unnecessary. But if you have ever picked a lock for a whole minute, you really want at least at some interactions a toggle function. So I copied the code from the WolfHUD mod, which does this job, and modified it a little.
Now you can add toggle interaction to every HUD you want.

Put the folder into your mod folder in your PAYDAY 2 directorie
